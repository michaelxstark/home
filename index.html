      <div class="first">
        My name is Michael, and I am a musician, composer, actor, and creative coder.
        I tour as a musician with artists such as OSKA, Doppelfinger, and Magdalena Wawra,
        compose music for theater and advertisements, and lead workshops on field recording.
        Additionally, I host the series sound:chat at Wiener Konzerthaus,
        develop audio-reactive software and online music applications,
        and conduct research on data sonification and improvisational practices in electronic music.
